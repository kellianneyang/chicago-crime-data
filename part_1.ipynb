    "1. Use data from the Chicago Data Portal: Crimes 2001 to Present, which includes type of crime, date/time, lat/long, District/ward, arrests, etc.\n",
    "    - https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2\n",

    "2. Use this data processing helper notebook to process large Chicago crime data .csv into several smaller .csv.gz files for analysis.\n",

    "        - (A) Which district has the most crimes? \n",
    "        - (B) Which has the least?\n",
    "    - (2) Crimes Across the Years:\n",
    "        - (A) Is the total number of crimes increasing or decreasing across the years?\n",
    "        - (B) Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (i.e., decreasing when orverall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?\n",
    "    - (3) Comparing AM vs. PM Rush Hour:\n",
    "        - (A) Are crimes more common during AM rush hour or PM rush hour? Consider 7am-10am and 4pm-7pm as rush hours.\n",
    "        - (B) What are the top 5 most common crimes during AM rush hour? What are the top 5 most common crimes during PM rush hour?\n",
    "        - (C) Are MOtor Vehicle Thefts more common during AM rush hour or PM rush hour?\n",
    "    - (4) Comparing Months:\n",
    "        - (A) What months have the most crime? What months have the least?\n",
    "        - (B) Are there any individual crimes that do not follow this pattern? If so, which crimes?\n",
    "    - (5) Comparing Holidays:\n",
    "        - (A) Are there any holidays that show an increase in the number of crimes?\n",
    "        - (B) Are there any holidays that show a decrease in the number of crimes?"
